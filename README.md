6. then use `validator.py` to validate the codes (tries to redeem at apple and if it fails, the code is invalid)

## requirements
- python installed

## disclaimer

this tool is for educational and testing purposes only. most codes DO NOT work because of how hard it is to generate a working code. pls dont use the codes for any illegal activities. i am not responsible for what you do with these codes. also please don't open an issue about it not generating any valid codes because while it IS possible, it takes a long time to actually generate one.
